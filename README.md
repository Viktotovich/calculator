# calculator
Pretext:
Calculator app based on all my knowledge to date (12th April, 02:20, 2024). Objects, Arrays, and more!

Completed on 14th of April 01:10, 2024. 

Warning: This app has spaghetti code, and some good code. It took me a while to make and while there are still bugs - it is an MVP that I am satisfied with. 

If you are looking at this project years (or months) down the line, please note - that this code were my abilities as of the aforementioned date - and have since exponentially scaled with time. 

I am proud of this project, because just a few months ago - I didn't even know how to open an IDE. This project is a hallmark of my dedication, time, energy, creativity, and passion.
